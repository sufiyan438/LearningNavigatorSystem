This project deals with the exam enrollment process for a Learning Management System.

Students are expected to enroll for a subject post which they can register for an exam. Multiple checks and balances have been placed through the project to ensure that whatever is being input in the database is valid.

Firstly, a subject needs to be created following which an exam for the subject can be scheduled. Post this, the student can enroll for a subject and then register for its exam.

The entities have been mapped accordingly and errors have been gracefully handled.

Thank you!
